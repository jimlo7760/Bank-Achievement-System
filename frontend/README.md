**Note**: For security reasons, the local development environment cannot access the production database. Use the **live demo** for full functionality. 

### If you want to preview a page specifically: 
Following the portion division on `frontend/src/components/AppRouter.jsx`, you can navigate to specific pages by commenting/uncommenting the portion.\
(e.g By default, it directs to the sign-up/login page, if you want to preview the admin dashboard, you can comment out the login/sign-up portion (as well as the employee portion) and uncomment the admin dashboard portion in the `AppRouter.jsx` file.)\
Same reason for if you want to preview the employee dashboard or any other pages. \
**Note**: Whenever you changed the `AppRouter.jsx` file, you will need to restart the server by following commands from step 3.
